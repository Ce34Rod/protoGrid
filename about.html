            Iâ€™m Cesar Rodriguez - and I have been a photographer for most of my life going to back to my first camera at the age of 10. 
            I specialize in personal portraits but can of course do photos for events like engagements, birthdays, graduations, and small weddings. 
            If you are looking for photos for a social media profile picture, dating apps, or just want a picture you look amazing in, you're in the right place! 
            I know from personal experience how terrifying it can be to have unflattering photos taken of you. It is my #1 priority that you feel attractive and 
            confident in your pictures. I believe everyone, no matter you look like on the outside, can have amazing photographs taken of them. Every human is beautiful 
            in one way or another and it is really my job to capture that as accurately as I can. I believe photography has the power to build confidence and that 
            is really what I believe my product is. Even just one nice photograph of yourself can completely change how you feel about yourself and your online presence
